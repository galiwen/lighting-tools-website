## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Architecture Decision: Validation-First Approach

**Decision**: Do NOT proceed with full React migration until current implementation is validated

**Rationale**: 
- Current implementation appears sophisticated and well-designed
- "Calculation crisis" claims need verification
- CLAUDE.md emphasizes "simplicity first" and avoiding over-engineering
- Risk mitigation: validate before major changes

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Test current calculations vs Excel model
2. If accurate: enhance incrementally
3. If inaccurate: fix calculations first, then consider UI improvements
4. Only migrate to React if clear user value demonstrated

### Technology Stack Decision: Hybrid Approach

**If Enhancement Path**:
- Keep current HTML/CSS/JS foundation
- Add TypeScript for calculations
- Selective React components for new features
- Maintain proven design system

**If Migration Path**:
- React + TypeScript (as originally planned)
- Preserve current design system in Tailwind
- Maintain mobile-first responsive patterns
- Zero visual regression tolerance

### Calculation Engine Strategy

**Priority 1**: Excel accuracy (0.1% tolerance)
**Priority 2**: Performance (calculations <50ms)  
**Priority 3**: Transparency (show calculation steps)
**Priority 4**: Extensibility (easy to add new features)
