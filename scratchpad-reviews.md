---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: üîÑ MAJOR STRATEGIC PIVOT IDENTIFIED - Document contains two distinct strategic visions

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Document has been significantly expanded (from 499 to 809 lines) with an ambitious "Phase 4: Enterprise Transformation" strategy that fundamentally changes project scope and objectives.

**Key Strategic Tensions**:
1. **Original Plan** (lines 1-499): Focused, realistic React migration with Excel parity
2. **New Expansion** (lines 500-809): Massive enterprise platform vision with complex multi-standard analysis

**Primary Concern**: The new Phase 4 strategy appears to violate core "simplicity first" principle from CLAUDE.md and may introduce significant execution risk.
