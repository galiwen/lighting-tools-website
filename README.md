### Calculation Engine
```javascript
// Core calculation structure
Total GWP = Embodied + Operational + End of Life

// With grid decarbonization
for (year = 0; year < projectLife; year++) {
    gridFactorForYear = gridFactor * (1 - decarbonizationRate)^year
    operationalGWP += annualEnergy * gridFactorForYear
}

// With proper replacement timing
for (replacement = 1; replacement <= replacements; replacement++) {
    replacementYear = floor(replacement * lifetimeYears)
    inflatedCost = cost * (1 + inflationRate)^replacementYear
}
```
